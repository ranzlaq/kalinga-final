# **A Mathematical Model on Breast-to-Hotspot Temperature Asymmetry and Breast Temperature Variation Through AI-Based Thermography Analysis for Breast Cancer Pre-Screening**

This repository hosts the code for KALINGA, an AI-based thermography analysis tool developed as part of a research study focusing on early breast cancer pre-screening.

The project implements a mathematical model trained under the YOLO architecture to quantify the thermal risk associated with breast tissue. The utilization concerns the insight that cancerous or pre-cancerous regions (notably termed: hotspots) exhibit significantly higher temperature asymmetry (ΔT) compared to the surrounding healthy breast tissue, and that bilateral temperature asymmetry is a key diagnostic indicator.

## **KALINGA pipeline**
+ Breast-to-Hotspot Temperature Asymmetry (ΔT): Quantifies the difference between the maximum temperature in a detected hotspot and the median temperature of the corresponding breast region.
+ Bilateral Asymmetry: Compares thermal patterns and median and standard deviation metrics between the left and right breasts.
+ Temperature Variation (σ): Analyzes the standard deviation of temperature across the breast region as a measure of thermal stability.
+ Thermal Analysis Report & Diagnostic Summary: Deliberates thermal differences and significant hotspot rise in order to provide visual evidence of detected hotspots and a comprehensive, quantitative report to aid in preliminary, non-invasive risk assessment.

## **RESEARCH ABSTRACT**
Breast cancer remains one of the leading causes of mortality among women worldwide. In the Philippines, numerous cases are diagnosed at late stages due to limitations of mammography, creating barriers to early detection and lowering survival rates. Hotspots and temperature variations are often indicative of breast abnormalities, the study explored thermography and artificial intelligence as a cost-effective pre-screening tool. A dataset of 593 thermograms were obtained after augmentation. These images were classified into six categories: normal-left, normal-right, abnormal-left, abnormal-right, HOTSPOT-left, and HOTSPOT-right, annotated under the guidance of a surgical oncologist, and were used to train three machine learning models: YOLOv8, YOLOv11, and YOLOv12. During initial training, the models achieved mAP50 values of 58%, 70.4%, and 58.5%, and training loss of 25%, 18%, and 23% respectively, with YOLOv11 obtaining the highest. Further analysis identified the 100th epoch as its optimal performance, yielding a 92% accuracy in terms of confusion matrix.  The chosen model detects regions of interest specifically the left and right breast along with potential hotspots. Through a series of formula derivations, a mathematical model that computes breast-to-hotspot temperature asymmetry and temperature variation were developed, where significant differences serve as an indicator of breast abnormalities. To enhance interpretability, visual representation of the temperature asymmetry were used alongside a rule-based explanation system that translates these findings into textual diagnoses, categorizing it as “minimal,” “moderate,” or “significant”.  The results suggest that the mathematical model is capable of pre-screening breast abnormalities that could lead to serious conditions including cancer.
